Work has been slower with the semeseter starting up on top of everything else that comes with college. I've been working on animaitons and backend stuff for the game. Not much to report but it's starting to look and feel more like a real game.

Got the inventory system and menus working and I'm actually pretty proud with how they turned out. I think they're pretty 
slick, although I still need a few more elements before they're completley finished. Almost done with the first area too but by
"almost" that could also mean another week or two of work, this is taking muuuuch longer than WtB especially with having to build all these
new mechanics from scratch, but I'm hoping it will be a banger. Today I want to get all of the actually important doors and rooms working and 
looking better and then I can start working on the puzzle design and other fun stuff. Yesterday I wrestled with Unity for hoursss trying to get
occlusion culling to work properly and there's still a few hiccups but it works for the most part. Baked lighting was giving me a few problems too
but nothing I couldn't manage. I'm still procrastinating on modeling the main character but it will get done eventually (probably after I finish the
first area tbh).

I've made a lot of progress on the first actual area (which I can't really show you guys sorry) but I'm gonna need to write a lotttttt of code
soon to actually make it a game where you can interact with things like doors or items you know the usual stuff. I was looking through some of
my old code from WtB and came across wonderful forgotten scripts such as "Floater" and "fishScript". I couldn't tell you what either of those
were used for. But anyways I think I'm starting to take this in the direction I want it to go, the hardest part is just actually making it happen
especially with summer coming to a close faster than I'd like it to haha.

Finally got to building the website today after wrestling with Google and Squarespace all day yesterday to reroute the DNS through Github 
so I could actually build this myself. Took a while to dust off my lackluster HTML and CSS skills to cobble together this website but it's not looking 
too bad imo. What I'd like to do is have a seperate page for each game but when the Steam page already exists for WtB it seems sorta like a lot of
work that won't really be worth it. I still need ideas of things to add to the website considering it's pretty bare bones rn but I'm proud that it exists
in the first place.I've only ever had an itchi.city page before so this is a big step up. Tomorrow I'll probably work on rebranding the twitter and
discord server so everything looks more official since that's what this is all about.
